## Layout:
We can't really have python take the input from touch osc, feed it to Wekinator and take it back, so I found some code that takes the accelerometer data from touchOSC and using some code we all have already written we can pretty easily put that into processing. From there I make a pygame that works currently with keys for testing, but will listen to osc. I am working on that part though the game works currently.
